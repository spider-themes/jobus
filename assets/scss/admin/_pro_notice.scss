/*
 * CSS for Jobus Pro Feature Lock/Unlock
 *
 * This stylesheet manages the display and behavior of the "Pro" badge and lock effect for premium-only fields in the Jobus admin options panel.
 *
 * - By default, fields with the class `.jobus-pro-locked.csf-field` show a "Pro" badge and are visually locked (reduced opacity, pointer-events: none).
 * - If the field also has the class `.active-theme-jobi` and the body has the class `jobi` (Jobi theme is active), the badge is hidden and the field is unlocked (full opacity, pointer-events: inherit).
 * - This logic ensures that Jobi theme users get free access to pro features, while other themes see the lock and badge.
 * - For future-proofing, add similar logic for child themes if needed.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   - Add `jobus-pro-locked` to any field that should be locked for non-Jobi themes.
 *   - Add `active-theme-jobi` to unlock for Jobi theme (done in PHP options logic).
