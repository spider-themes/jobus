/**
 * Classic Tax Wrapper End
 * This template is used to display the end of the classic tax wrapper for job listings.
 *
 * This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/jobus/loop/classic-tax-wrapper-end.php.
 *
 * HOWEVER, on occasion Jobus will need to update template files and you
 * (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
 * maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
 * happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
 * the readme will list any important changes.

 * @package Jobus/Templates
